Main VS Branches

Main is Default and Primary Branch in Git as 
it's usually the baseline from which other branches are created

Usually the stable and production-ready code exists in the main branch

Branch:

made mainly to work simultaneously without affecting the baseline code or the main branch
And Allow the reviewers to review each branch before pushing or merging to the main branch
and ensure stability of the main branch
